=====================

A simple listing tool to keep track of current civic tech projects of the BetaNYC community.  

This is an adapataiton of the [Open Gov Hack Night's Projects Page](https://github.com/open-city/open-gov-hack-night) in Chicago, recreated using the [MEAN Stack](http://www,mean.io).

The idea is to use the Github profile for each project as the information source.  Project name, owner, description, collaborators, issues, etc are pulled via the github api. 

All humans need to do is determine what repos to include, all of which are in projects.json.
